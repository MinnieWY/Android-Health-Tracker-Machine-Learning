# 23CS079 A Mobile-based Health Tracker Application with Fitbit
Welcome to the repository for the final year project _A Mobile-based Health Tracker Application with Fitbit_ ! This project is divided into three main components: a React Native frontend, a SpringBoot backend, and a Flask-based Machine Learning module. Below you will find a brief description of this repository which is used as the prediction model.

## Flask-based Machine Learning
The Flask-based Machine Learning module is responsible for performing data analysis and providing predictions to the backend. It leverages machine learning algorithms to process input data and generate meaningful insights. To set up the machine learning module, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine (Python 3.6 or higher).
2. Navigate to the machine_learning directory.
3. Create a virtual environment using python -m venv venv.
4. Activate the virtual environment using source venv/bin/activate (Linux) or venv\Scripts\activate (Windows).
5. Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
6. Run the Flask server using python app.py.
7. The machine learning module should now be running and ready to receive requests from the backend.
